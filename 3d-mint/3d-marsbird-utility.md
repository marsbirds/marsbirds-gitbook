# ðŸ¦‰ 3D MarsBird Utility

As a holder of a 3D MarsBird, you will have access to a variety of exclusive features and opportunities that are not available to holders of 2D MarsBirds.

One of the most exciting aspects of owning a 3D MarsBird is the ability to participate in player-versus-player (PvP) battles within the game. In these battles, you will be able to team up with other 3D MarsBird holders to take on other players and earn rewards. This feature adds an extra layer of excitement and competition to the game, and provides 3D MarsBird holders with additional ways to earn rewards.

Another benefit of owning a 3D MarsBird is the ability to receive 3D printable files of your MarsBird. This allows you to create physical merchandise such as figurines, keychains, and more. This is a unique opportunity for 3D MarsBird holders to show off their digital assets in the real world, and is a feature that is not available to holders of 2D MarsBirds.

In addition to these features, 3D MarsBird holders will also have access to exclusive NFT raffles and other opportunities to earn rewards. This makes owning a 3D MarsBird an attractive proposition for anyone who is looking to take their MarsBirds experience to the next level.

Some holders may be concerned that 2D MarsBirds will lose value as a result of the introduction of 3D MarsBirds. However, it is important to remember that both types of MarsBirds serve different purposes and have their own unique value. 2D MarsBirds will continue to be an important part of the MarsBirds ecosystem, and will remain a valuable asset for holders.

Overall, owning a 3D MarsBird provides holders with a range of unique benefits and opportunities that are not available to holders of 2D MarsBirds. From the ability to participate in PvP battles to the ability to create physical merchandise, 3D MarsBirds offer a unique and exciting experience for holders.
