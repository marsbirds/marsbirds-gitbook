# üóù Golden Keycards

The Golden Keycard page should read as follows:

The Golden Keycard is a special keycard that allows holders to claim a one-time discount of 40% on their first mint of a 3D MarsBird. There is a limited supply of 8888 Golden Keycards, so be sure to grab yours before they're gone!

Here's how it works:

* To claim your discount, you'll need to have a Golden Keycard in your wallet
* When you're ready to mint your 3D MarsBird, simply select the Golden Keycard as your payment method during the minting process
* The discount will be applied to your mint, and you'll be able to claim your discounted 3D MarsBird

Please note that the Golden Keycard can only be used once per wallet, and it cannot be traded or transferred. So make sure to use it wisely or play the game to get each of your MarsBirds 1 each! Thanks for being a part of the MarsBirds community, and happy minting!
