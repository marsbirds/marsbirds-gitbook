# ðŸŽ® MarsBirds Game

* **What is the objective of the game?** \
  Your MarsBirds have landed on Mars, and the first thing they need is Oxygen. The only place you'll be certain to find it is in aboveground on the Martian landscape, which is airdropped by drones. However, ancient Martians have burrowed nearby and will stop at nothing to defend their home. You will need to kill as many aliens as you can, either by yourself or with a teammate, to gain points and unlock better weapons and armor before it's too late.
* **What utility does the game provide?** \
  The game provides the ability to earn rewards in ADA, battle competitively with fungible tokens at stake, discounts on mints for playing, and increases the value of $MARS.
* **What utility does the game add for $MARS in the future?** \
  Players will be able to change the cosmetic look of their 3D MarsBirds by buying in-game cosmetic upgrades. This will create unique skins and emotes for their 3D MarsBirds.
* **Will certain MarsBird traits have special abilities?** \
  ****Almost every rare trait has a special ability that represents its trait. For example, Robots have a long time without Oxygen (20 Second Oxygen Bar).
* **Will players without special traits be able to pick them up in-game for points?** \
  ****Yes.
* **What genre is the game?** \
  The game is a third-person Survival Game, with Battle Royale PvP coming soon.
* **How can I play?** \
  ****To play the game, you will need to hold 1 MarsBird and download the game at the official download link.
