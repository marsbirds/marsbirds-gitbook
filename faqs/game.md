# ðŸŽ® MarsBirds Game

What's the objective of the game?

Your MarsBirds have finally landed on Mars, but itâ€™s only the beginning of their journey on their new planet. The first thing thatâ€™s needed is Oxygen and the only place you'll be certain to find it is in an aboveground observatory station on Mars! It wonâ€™t be an easy journey to remain alive on Mars. Ancient Martians burrowed nearby when they saw us arrive, and they will stop at nothing to defend their home

You will need to kill as many aliens as you can with your teammate to gain points to unlock better weapons and armour before it's too late! (edited) \[20:45] \_\_

Does it add utility for $MARS on launch day?

There wonâ€™t be any utility added for the initial launch of the game for $MARS. We want to mitigate any monetary risk to $MARS until we can clearly identify any bugs that expose themselves while real users test the game by playing

What utility does the game add for $MARS in the future?

Being unique is important to us in the NFT space, so you will be able to change the cosmetic look of your 3D MarsBird by buying in-game cosmetic upgrades for your 3D MarsBird to create unique skins and emotes for your 3D MarsBird

Does your in-game avatar (3D MarsBird) represent the MarsBird in your wallet?

The in-game 3D avatar does represent the 2D MarsBird in your wallet. You connect your wallet, we read the policy ID and match the serial number of your 2d bird with the 3d version for in-game use! It's as simple as that!
