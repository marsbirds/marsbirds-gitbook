# â™» $MARS/ $ADA Claiming

To claim your $MARS or $ADA, follow these steps:

1. Visit the link: [https://app.marsbirds.art/claim](https://app.marsbirds.art/claim)
2. Click "Explore" and then "Claim"
3. Connect your wallet with a MarsBird or $MARS in it
4. Choose whether to claim $MARS or $ADA
5. Submit the transaction and wait for your funds to arrive

Please note that only wallets compatible with Eternl, NAMI, Gero, and Flint can be used to claim. If your MarsBirds are in a Yoroi or Daedalus wallet, you will need to restore your wallet in a different wallet app or send your assets to a wallet that has dapp connections available. The ETERNL Mobile Wallet can also be used to claim via the DApp browser.

If you encounter any issues with claiming, please open a ticket in our Discord channel. You can find more information about claiming in our FAQ section.
