# ðŸ§  Whats $MARS?

* $MARS is accumulated via Burrowing your MarsBirds or you can purchase it from your favourite DEX&#x20;
* $MARS is used to vote for DAO Proposals, enter NFT raffles via Mutants Lab, and more uses will be announced
* $MARS can be burned for $ADA from our treasury&#x20;
* $MARS supply is infinite and fluctuates depending on how much $MARS is burned each EPOCH
* $MARS gains it value from the $ADA in the burrowing treasury
* 7.5% of our mint sales and 7.5% of our secondary sales goes to our Burrowing treasury wallet that's pegged to the $MARS token. Meaning the more secondary sales, the more the $ADA value of $MARS goes up
* You can search if a MarsBird has unclaimed $MARS via this link - [https://app.marsbirds.art/explore](https://app.marsbirds.art/explore)
* $MARS is attached to the bird and not the wallet holding the bird, so only the current owner can claim $MARS from a bird
* &#x20;Rarity does not affect how much $MARS a bird accumalates
