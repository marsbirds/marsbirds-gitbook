# ðŸ§  Whats $MARS?

$MARS is a token that is used within the MarsBirds ecosystem. It is accumulated through burrowing your MarsBirds, or can be purchased from a DEX.

$MARS is used for voting on DAO proposals, entering NFT raffles through Mutants Lab, and will have other uses that will be announced in the future.

$MARS can be burned for $ADA from our treasury, and its supply is infinite and fluctuates depending on how much $MARS is burned each epoch. The value of $MARS is derived from the $ADA in our burrowing treasury.

7.5% of our mint sales and 7.5% of our secondary sales went towards our burrowing treasury wallet on the 2D set. 10% of the 3D mint sales and 1% of the secondary market royalties will also be dedicated to $MARS.

You can check if a MarsBird has unclaimed $MARS by searching for it on our explorer. Keep in mind that $MARS is attached to the bird and not the wallet holding it, so only the current owner can claim $MARS from a bird. Rarity does not affect how much $MARS a bird can accumulate.
