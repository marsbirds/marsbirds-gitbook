# üè¶ Burrowing Treasury

## What's the Burrowing Treasury:bank:

The Burrowing Treasury is an essential part of the MarsBirds project. It is where 7.5% of the minting revenue and 7.5% of the royalties from secondary sales are sent. This creates value for $MARS and ensures that the project remains sustainable.

When the owners of MarsBirds claim their $MARS, that is new $MARS that is minted and didn't exist previously on the blockchain. The funds from the royalties wallet are sent to the Burrowing Treasury every EPOCH. As it stands, the more secondary sales, the more valuable MARS becomes because of the royalties that get sent to the Burrow each EPOCH.

In addition to the minting revenue and secondary sales, 100% of the mint sale of Copper keycards and 10% of the 3D sale will also be sent to the Burrowing Treasury. This ensures that the project remains sustainable and that the value of $MARS continues to grow.
