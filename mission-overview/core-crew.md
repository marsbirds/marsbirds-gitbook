Hi! Iâ€™m Cybird the founder of MarsBirds When I joined the NFT community last year I knew I wanted to create a project involving pixel NFTs with amazing tech backing it up and thatâ€™s how MarsBirds began I and DEV are heavily focused on technological improvements, so our project will not just compromise quality pixel art but also useful tools being built in-house that we can use and out-source to help other projects MarsBird proves that quality art and tech can live together in unison **Welcome to MarsBirds**&#x20;
