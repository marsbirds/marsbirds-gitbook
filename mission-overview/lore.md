# ðŸ“š MarsBirds Lore

The year is 2249. It's a year that everyone remembers well, the year we Owls had to leave Earth

Earth became uninhabitable because of the pollution, harsh climate and lack of water. These were only some of the reasons the civilisation on Earth died out, besides the wise Owl

Owls predicted the future of Earth correctly which allowed them to plan ahead. Everyone else ignored the signs, but Owls began to burrow deep beneath the Earth to avoid the harsh conditions above which allowed them to build their underground space station

Another problem Owls predicted accurately was the currency on Earth becoming valueless. The solution was simple, a token distributed equally amongst birds in the burrow called MARS

With the solutions to Earth's problems solved on paper, all that was left was to build them

It took them 339 days to build their space station and currency MARS. Once everything was complete, all they had to do was gather the Parliament for liftoff!

With the Parliament secured in their spaceship, the Captain presses the button that's their ticket to MARSâ€¦ LIFTOFF!

The spaceship shoots out of Earth's orbit into space. It was a successful launch for the Parliament, but the journey only begins

As the Parliament moves at warp speed through space, excitement and nervousness set in as they approach MARS

They arrive! The Captain knows the air is not suitable for Owls, so he quickly attaches his Oxygen tank and begins walking around on MARS

The first thing he notices is a lot of wind and sun, which is great for solar panels and windmills to generate power for the Burrow

There are many rock surfaces, meaning they can burrow their way into the rock surface to create homes that will protect them from the harsh conditions outside

He notices moisture on parts of the surface and realises if they dig deep enough they could extract water from down below

The Captain looks around once more at Mars before saying, Welcome MarsBirds
