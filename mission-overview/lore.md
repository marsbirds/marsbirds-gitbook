# ðŸ“š MarsBirds Lore

As the first inhabitants of Mars, the MarsBirds faced many challenges. After leaving Earth due to its unsustainable conditions, they arrived on the red planet ready to create a new home for themselves. However, they were quickly met by strange Martian creatures, who seemed to resent the MarsBirds' arrival.

Determined to survive, the MarsBirds used their advanced technology, including drones that airdropped them weapons, armor, and oxygen pods. These oxygen pods allowed them to survive on the surface, as long as they stayed close to them.

Despite their best efforts, the MarsBirds faced constant attacks from the Martian creatures. For every one they managed to kill, two more seemed to appear. It was a difficult and dangerous time for the MarsBirds.

In order to survive, the MarsBirds began to burrow underground, creating an underground world for themselves. This allowed them to avoid the hostile Martian creatures and continue to thrive on the planet.

Despite the challenges they faced, the MarsBirds persevered and continued to build a new home for themselves on the red planet. Through determination and hard work, they have carved out a place for themselves on Mars, and continue to thrive in this harsh and unforgiving environment.
