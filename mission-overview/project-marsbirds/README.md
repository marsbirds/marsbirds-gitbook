# ðŸš€ Project MarsBirds

## Welcome to the world of MarsBirds!

MarsBirds is a unique NFT project on the Cardano blockchain that aims to provide utility and value to its holders. Our goal is to create a diverse collection of on-chain PFPs that can be used as your digital identity on the web3.

But MarsBirds is more than just NFTs - we are also building a community of holders who have a say in the direction of the project. As a verified holder of MarsBirds, you will have access to exclusive perks like voting on the project's outcome, giveaways, and waiting list spots for upcoming releases.

But the real fun begins when you start Burrowing your MarsBirds. Burrowing means you keep those birds nestled in your wallet off the secondary market, and the longer they are burrowed, the more $MARS you accumulate each EPOCH (every 5 days). This $MARS can be burned for ADA.

To learn more about the technicals of Burrowing and the distribution of $MARS, please read our [**Burrowing Whitepaper**](burrowing-whitepaper.md). And to stay up-to-date on the latest developments at MarsBirds, follow us on Twitter and join our Discord community.

We are excited to have you as part of the MarsBirds family and can't wait to see what the future holds for our project. Let's take flight together and build something truly special on the Cardano blockchain.
