# â„¹ Burrowing Whitepaper

The Burrowing Whitepaper is a comprehensive guide to the mechanics behind the MarsBirds project. It details how MARS is distributed to holders, how to accumulate MARS by Burrowing your MarsBirds, and how the Burrowing Treasury works.

In this whitepaper, you'll learn about the concept of Burrowing, where MarsBirds are nestled in wallet addresses off the secondary market. This allows holders to accumulate MARS, which is distributed every EPOCH (every 5 days).

The Burrowing Treasury is where a portion of minting and service fees are sent, creating value for MARS. The more MARS that is burned, the more valuable it becomes, as the funds from the royalties wallet are sent to the Burrowing Treasury every EPOCH.
